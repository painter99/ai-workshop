# PHASE 1 — PYTHON FOUNDATIONS (Competency-based; likely Months 1–3)

## Goal
Master the syntax required to handle data for AI pipelines.

## CORE
- Ardit "Python Mega Course" (Main stream)

## REFERENCE (only when stuck)
- PY4E targeted chapters (files, functions, errors)

## OFFLINE STUDY (Logic over Code)
- When away from PC: Study the concept of "Embeddings" and "Tokenization" from LLM Engineer's Handbook.
- Understand why LLMs see numbers, not words.

## Practice habit
- Session logs (short, consistent)

## What you focus on (skills list)
### A) Data types & control flow
- str, int, float, bool
- if/elif/else, match/case
- while, for, enumerate

### B) Collections
- list: append/remove/indexing/slicing
- dict: keys/values/items, membership, safe lookup

### C) Functions
- define functions
- parameters/return values
- scope basics (local/global awareness)

### D) Files & persistence
- open/read/write text files
- JSON load/dump (basic)

### E) Error handling
- read Traceback
- handle invalid user input (basic try/except)

### F) Output structure
- f-strings
- clean console output, numbering, formatting

## Deliverables (portfolio micro-artifacts)
- Session logs (like you already do)
- 2–3 small scripts saved, not just typed once (e.g., todo.py, filenames.py, text_cleaner.py for future RAG)
- "Notes" file with your own definitions (Traceback, iterable, etc.)

## Gate 1 (PASS/FAIL)
PASS if you can, without help:
- Write a script that reads a file and writes a file (txt or json)
- Use functions to split logic (at least 2 functions)
- Use list/dict correctly and explain indexing (0 vs 1)
- Add basic try/except for user input
- Explain what a Traceback says (file, line, error type)

## IMPORTANT
- As soon as Gate 1 is PASS, you may move on even if Ardit is not finished.
