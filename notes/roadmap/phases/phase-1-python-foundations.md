# PHASE 1 — PYTHON FOUNDATIONS (Competency-based; likely Months 1–3)

## CORE

- Ardit "Python Mega Course" (this stays the main stream)

## REFERENCE (only when stuck)

- PY4E targeted chapters (files, functions, errors)

## Practice habit

- Your session logs (keep them short, consistent)

## What you focus on (skills list)

### A) Data types & control flow

- str, int, float, bool
- if/elif/else, match/case
- while, for, enumerate

### B) Collections

- list: append/remove/indexing/slicing
- dict: keys/values/items, membership, safe lookup

### C) Functions

- define functions
- parameters/return values
- scope basics (local/global awareness)

### D) Files & persistence

- open/read/write text files
- JSON load/dump (basic)

### E) Error handling

- read Traceback
- handle invalid user input (basic try/except)

### F) Output structure

- f-strings
- clean console output, numbering, formatting

## Deliverables (portfolio micro-artifacts)

- Session logs (like you already do)
- 2–3 small scripts saved, not just typed once (e.g., todo.py, filenames.py)
- "Notes" file with your own definitions (Traceback, iterable, etc.)

## Gate 1 (PASS/FAIL)

PASS if you can, without help:

- Write a script that reads a file and writes a file (txt or json)
- Use functions to split logic (at least 2 functions)
- Use list/dict correctly and explain indexing (0 vs 1)
- Add basic try/except for user input
- Explain what a Traceback says (file, line, error type)

## IMPORTANT

- As soon as Gate 1 is PASS, you may move on even if Ardit is not finished.
